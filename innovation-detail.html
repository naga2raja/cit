The highly digitalized world has also opened a host of new sectors like e-commerce, fintech and several others. We recognize that in order to stay in tune with the changing customers' needs and preferences, market and industry dynamic structure we must walk an extra mile to convert novel ideas to niche products in the real world</p>

                                       <h4> Methodology </h4>
                                        A part of our product innovation methodology is partially open innovation: we share our ideas and its progress as undertake the journey of conceptualization and engineering with our customers. This works both ways: our customers get a glimpse of our thought process and we get to have pinpointed feedback and animated discussions with our customers who are a kind of market leaders in their domain of business.The other aspects of our methodology include identifying and creating new opportunities for product innovation, developing a focused product plan keeping our customer expectations and designing a development strategy that plays on our strengths. In our line of work, technology is one of the catalytic elements of innovation. Into the new millennium and beyond, innovation has become a directed effort and our company focuses on technology revolutions to innovate for market. The forums and blogs discuss about the challenges and pain points with technical webinars exposing the latest breakthroughs, a perceptive mind has an opportunity to combine and create novel solutions. We innovate primarily for the sake of our customers and secondarily for the market. We carry out two complementary innovations for our customers. We carry out two complementary innovations for our customers.

                                        <h4>Incremental Innovation</h4>
                                        Innovations that are incremental in nature are a big value adds. These especially happen when we work on customer projects and our keenness with eagerness for innovation leads to the proposal of incremental innovations on our customer requirements. In our own experience, customers consider such proposals very seriously and schedule them in their product roadmap. An illustrative example of incremental innovation is to suggest a novel way to reduce the overall energy consumption. Energy, these days, is a paramount resource and, from multiple perspectives, having a strict control over energy consumption patterns within our customer project helps brand their product in the market very effectively. 
                                    </p>

                                      <h4>Full-fledged Innovation</h4>
                                        As opposed to the incremental innovations, we submit our product related ideas to our customers for their consideration. In a sense, we want to explore whether any of our customers are interested to make our proposal as part of their portfolio. An alternative for us to build a quick and compelling prototype that convincingly demonstrates our idea to both our customers and market segments. An illustrative product innovation is to reengineer the product features so as to reduce the overall cost. A case in point is to reduce the overall form factor either in terms of physical dimension or memory footprint. We at CABCS Group are at the forefront in helping the market and customers in adopting the latest technologies and serve them with the cutting-edge products.

                                        We are a software and systems design and development house, and, on a continuous basis, we stay focused on aligning our activities along a pre-defined set of services that evolve to account for the growth behavior of our customers. The nature of services and the pace of change have shifted dramatically in recent years and mastering the traditional aspects of service delivery will no longer be enough. This makes us to offer our services to our customers in the most effective and productive way. The dynamism in the market space is reflected in what our customers do, and this demands us to be very agile as well. More than ever, consumers demand greater involvement, customization, personalization, and mobility from services—with immediate results. When they see cutting-edge service innovations in one industry, they expect to find them in others as well; witness the spread of self-service kiosks from airline check-ins to the retailing and hospitality industries. As industry boundaries increasingly blur for customers, companies must look for new ideas beyond their immediate rivals.

An illustrative example in service innovation involves evolving from process automation to Internet of Things. In this case, the design and development services involve extensive use of evolving frameworks, dealing with big data and usage of open sources.

                                        Our services to our customers are delivered by following a well-tested and matured delivery process. Quite often, though, the process needs to be evolved, adapted and tailored depending the project situations. While we have a detailed software and system design and development processes along with quality related document templates and use them effectively while we work on a customer project, it is required to briefly investigate the direct applicability of the prevailing process and the best practices for the customer project and adapt if needed. However, upon completion of the project, we get an opportunity to learn from the way the project got executed to seek incremental improvements for the process. Again, from our customer point of view, process innovations help reduce cost, processing time and risk.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="info-details">
                                        Organization novelty and developing technology drive the process innovation. That’s why we have adopted a companywide scheme to enhance software development process. We are using the systematic innovation model to generate new ideas and innovative ways to solve problems with the existing agile model. Our problem-solving approach and innovation processes include 6-sigma, Lean thinking, IDEO, ARIZ (Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving) and SI (Systematic Innovation).
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="info-details">
                                        Improvement of design quality, boosting of development capabilities (in terms of volume), and keeping up with technological trends are the top three issues in embedded software development, with the challenge being to achieve both quality and volume in software development while also dealing with the steady stream of new technologies that are emerging. Innovation in software development will be an essential management practice for creating customer value using the next generation of technology.
                                    </p>

                                        Note that process innovation is the direct consequence of service innovation. In our context, process innovation implies a new or improved delivery methodology including changes in equipment and platform details. Again, from our customer point of view, process innovations help reduce cost, processing time and risk.

                                        Energy control allows for intelligent management of energy for higher energy efficiencies. Every industry/home needs to be very conscious of how efficiently energy is being used and thereby contributing towards sustainable environment. Machine learning, especially deep learning can help energy management in a big way. Such AI based energy controllers can help achieve, say, building optimization, to largely reduce energy intensity and operational cost while not compromising person comfort. Many a times, in the initial stages, applied research requirements proceeds in a collaborative manner so that the customer purpose and context can be well understood.

                                        Quality Assurance is a broader, more systematic approach. It’s a way of assessing the quality of the product and making sure it meets the expectations of a client/a market segment QA goes beyond just testing it involves quality assessment of both product and the production process. During the process of quality assurance, significant number of metrics data is collected. The data helps not only the product under test but also allows for predictability to lay a strong foundation for ensuring high quality of products being developed.

                                        Software packages perform business-specific functions, as opposed to operating system or environmental software Most important is the fact that while operating system or environmental software upgrades are typically transparent to the business community, application software packages address gaps in the IT processes and services.From this point of view, software packages impact the end user operations. Data integration is yet another key requirement of any enterprise. Over a period, an enterprise evolves to bringing in more and more processes within the purview of IT infrastructure and this generates more and more data as well. Data integration allows for consolidating data from disparate sources into a homogenous source and providing access to refined data across the spectrum of the enterprise. And there are excellent third-part software packages exist and they can be integrated and exploited within an enterprise.

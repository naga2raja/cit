                                        Software development is complex. It’s no surprise that in each project, there are bound to be challenges: Understanding the end user, Transfer of domain knowledge understanding, Choosing right development platform that can justify requirement, Right skillful resources on board, Vigorous testing for robustness and Handling requirement changes. The application development always tends to have issues involved in it.

We employ rapid application development tools and agile methodology to ensure the development and delivery stay continuously aligned and to ensure that all the issues and challenges are handled sooner than later. We study, analyze and deeply understand the customer requirements so as to realize multiple versions of the proposed solution in an iterative manner. Each of the iterations’ deliverables is of value to our customers thereby incrementally building the grand solution.

                                        Solution engineering addresses the pain points of our customers. We listen carefully to the customers’ descriptions of their challenges and evolve a customer-specific solution engineering plan and share the same with the customer for their consideration. This gives an opportunity for us to understand a customer problem more deeply and come out with our plan of action. Subsequently, we undertake to integrate our developed solution with the customer IT infrastructure to derive the fullest benefits. </p>

                                    <p class="info-details">
                                        Many of our customers are very futuristic and proactive address their customers’ problems. This process requires quite a bit of investment from our customer side to ensure that they are in pace with technologies as well as advancements in their areas of focus. Our long-standing relationship with our customers helps us to effectively collaborate and significantly contribute. Applied research involves detailing studying, analysis and building of proof of concepts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="info-details">
                                        Some times this involves working on emerging platforms, evolving technologies and open sources. Over a period of time, we have developed a flair to explore, embrace and extend concepts and technologies to our customers’ advantage. For example, in the area of 5G technology, we explore specifications, technological developments and the application areas especially in the area of industrial IoT in manufacturing warehousing and large buildings that require large sensor connectivity with high capacity and high performance requirements. High capacity demands are higher in indoor stadiums where especially with 5G there is a great opportunity to enhance fan experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="info-details">
                                        We always look forward to solve practical problems of our customers. More specifically, the purpose and context of our applied research is invariably directed to solve problems that are relevant to our customers, while the employed methodology allows for external validation of the suggested / delivered solution. Proactively, we innovate as well and this is driven our own understanding of local and global markets. Market sensitivity and alignment is a very important aspect and we mix and match emerging technologies with market drivers. Another interesting area of our is energy and energy control, energy tracking and energy efficiencies are key topics of global interest.Energy control allows for intelligent management of energy leading higher energy efficiencies. Every industry/home needs to be very conscious of how efficiently energy is being used and thereby contributing towards sustainable environment. Deep learning in particular and machine learning in general can help energy management in a big way. Such AI based energy controllers can help achieve, say, building optimization, to largely reduce energy intensity and operational cost while not compromising person comfort. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="info-details">
                                        Another instance  of applied research is about enhancing the employee productivity (say, through Robotic Process Automation) and classifying and cataloging multimedia content (say, through Multimedia Analytics). Many a times, in the initial stages, applied research requirements proceeds in a collaborative manner so that the customer purpose and context can be well understood.

Robotic Process Automation provides with an unlimited resource pool that mimics human behavior and automates routine, repetitive tasks that hamper employees’ productivity. This resource pool is not made up of human oid robots, but software code that is delivered from the cloud to any location.

                                        Software packages perform business-specific functions, as opposed to operating system or environmental software Most important is the fact that while operating or environmental software upgrades are typically transparent to the business community, application software packages address gaps in the IT processes and services. From this point of view, software packages impact the end user operations. An example, is loan processing within, say, auto dealer. A suitable loan application processing software enables the dealer to provide more effective service to their customers. So, identifying the gaps, selecting the most appropriate third-party software package and integrating the same with the existing IT infrastructure so as to derive the maximum benefits from the software package become a key exploratory requirement of any enterprise. Data integration is yet another key requirement of any enterprise.
